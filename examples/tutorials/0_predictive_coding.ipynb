    "Unfortunately, we are not done. There's one more convention that need to be followed, and it's the difference between static and dynamic parameters (another key JAX concept). In general, you can think at it in this way: a tensor (even if it contains a single number) is a dynamic value, anything else is static. In details, a dynamic parameter is a parameter that *does not* alter the flow of execution of a program, but only its output. Think about the following function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "        return a - b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, different `a` and `b` values will produce different results but the required computation dependes exclusively on `op` (given that the type of `a` and `b` is fixed). Thus, `a` and `b` are dynamic parameters, `op` is static.\n",
    "This, however, means that we cannot use the value of `a` or `b` to alter the flow of the function. For example, the following is not valid:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def op(a: float, b: float, op: str):\n",

    "There are primitives that allow us to dynamically execute different pieces of code based on dynamic values and we will see them in another tutorial.\n",
    "To conclude this section, we always have to decide if a parameter is static (i.e., we want to use it as a *flag* to compile the same code multiple times with different behaviours) or dynamic (it is an actual parameter of the function we define). What happens is that static parameters are hardcoded into the function when it is compiled, and using different static values for the same parameter will result in a recompilation of the function.\n",

    "pcax follows the following convention: positional arguments are dynamic, keyword arguments are static. Thus, we would have to do the following to call `op`: `op(1.0, 2.0, op=\"+\")`. Note that this is necessary only for JAX-transformed functions (we'll look at them in a moment).\n",

JAX (and therefore pcax) defines each computation on a tensor assuming it contains a single sample (that is, there is no batch dimension as it happens, for instance, in Pytorch). Therefore, in the function above, `x` is supposed to be an array with shape [784,] (e.g., a flattened MNIST image) and `t` an array with shape [10,] (the corresponding one-hot encoded label). If we want `predict` to be able to work on batched input (i.e., `x` with shape [n, 784]), we need to *vectorize* the function such that the `predict` computation will be repeated along the batch dimension. In JAX, this is achieved using `vmap`.

    "It may be the case that your optimizers defines some parameters that are linked to the individual trainable parameter inside your model. For instance, you could choose to use `optax.adam` for `optim_x` (not recommended, for all we know you should stick with stateless optimizators for the value nodes). In this case, the optimizer needs to instantiate the `adam` parameters and, thus, it requires to know the shape of all the `px.NodeParams`s inside your model. However, if we do not run the model at least once, all the node values will be empty, since they are lazily created. Furthermore, the shape of the value nodes depends on the batch size (since, remember, we want different value nodes for each different input), so we need to perform a dummy run on a dummmy input with the same shape of the samples we are gonna train on to correctly initialize all the parameters inside the model. Only then we can safely create the two optimizers. (Note that this requires `batch_size` to be constant throught the program. To guarantee this, by default, the dataloaders have `drop_last=True`. Unless you know what you're doing, do not attempt to modify that.)\n",

In order to customise its batching behaviour `px.train` accepts all the kwargs you would normally pass to `pxu.vectorize` (all the other args will be passed to `model.__call__`).\n",

Of course, this is the correct intended behaviour.
